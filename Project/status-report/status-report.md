Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have made a registration, log-in, and log out system that keeps track of users and user names. We have also designed a page/way to create a new gallery and upload an individual photo (and provide a name for the photo) and save the gallery. And from the main log in page, there is a way for the user to click to view their galleries (howerver, this page has not been completed yet; we cannot get the photos to render)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

TODO

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We can't seem to figure out how to render our saved images onto a webpage
