# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pixelations Pro

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website/online platformn that allows artitsts to design, share, and curate online galleries of their work under their profile as well as view other artists' galleries.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Pixelations Pro will provide a site for artists to register and have an account. With this account, the artists will be able to create new and unique galleries (i.e. pages of sorts) where they can upload photos of their work to display, provide captions, and information as well as additional aspects about themselves such as information about their inspiration. This way artists can create pages that allow their work to be viewed as a whole (in a way that is best suited to them) rather than in pieces. This means the website will have functions that enable personaization: such as to create, title galleries, upload, caption, and organize photos.

In addition, we would like for the website to have a built in way to find and view other galleries and read more about other artists and their work (i.e. have a semi-social/interactive component). This can likely be done with a "most viewed" page and a search function (e.g. search bar, or criteria selection) that allows for users to find another gallery and leave comments.

This will be executed using python/flask, html, css, and sql.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

Judith Chang, judith.chang@yale.edu, Kelly Wei & Daphne Zhu
Tony Potchernikov, tony.potchernikov@yale.edu, Charlie Liu, Allie Liebmann

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have a log-in feature for each artist and way for artists to upload and view their photos to their account onto a designated page, as well as design an "about" page for the pixelations platform on the main site.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ontop of earlier features, artists can make several unique, stand-alone galleries that are tied to their account and add unique descriptions for each photo and have comment section for galleries. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ontop of earlier features, design a way to reorder/organize photos, search and see galleries from other accounts, and if possible have "most viewed galleries" tab, and way to see the "about" pages of other artists. There would be aspects of the page that the user can personalize, such as choosing layout from several presets.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps will be to make a rough outline of the page -- make the files, website template html file, and chunk out the features to be divvied up, and go through a similar process as the past P-Set to put things together.

We will likely need to do some research into creating log-ins, how to save/have users upload images, creating features where users can change/update the webpage content. Best case scenario, we will have to learn how to store and evaluate the number of times a person's profile was viewed as well as how to introduce presets for the user to choose.

We could informal research in speaking with other artists to understand what makes an online gallery successful (as opposed to an inperson gallery or individual artist website)

Judith and I will split the work by feature. For example, I will work on creating the feature for users to create new galleries, upload photos; Judith could design features for logging in, searching for other galleries, and leaving comments.
