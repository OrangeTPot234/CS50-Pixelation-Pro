## OVERVIEW:
Welcome to Pixelation PRO. Pixelation PRO is a social platform (similar to instagram) for artists to share their art as well as view other artists’ works.

## HOW IT WORKS:

## LOG IN AND REGISTRATION
The initial page that appears through the website link is a login page. If the user does not have a previous account, the user must first register for an account with a unique username. This can be done by pressing the “Register” button found at the top-right of the webpage (on the navbar). Then after successful registration, the user is directed to their homepage.

## NAVIGATION
The top of the webpage is the navigation bar. After successful login, users have the option to Log out from their session (“Log Out” button) and go to the homepage (press either the “Pixelation Pro” logo or “My Galleries” button).

## FUNCTIONS ON HOMEPAGE:

### USER PROFILE
Users can customize their profiles by updating their bios and profile picture. These options are found at bottom of homepage under "Profile Info". The user must upload BOTH a bio text and profile image in order to successfully update their user profile (there will be a user error preventing the upload if one or both pieces are missing). The User Profile Information (user profile picture and biography) will be displayed at the bottom of each of the user’s galleries, and will be available to the public and anyone viewing the galleries. There will be a link to the user's profile (hyperlinked to the User's username) found alongside with the user's profile information for other users to access.

### SEARCHING GALLERIES
On the homepage, there is a search bar (search bar under "Search Other Galleries") to view other galleries by typing in the target gallery's title. Or, if there is no specfic target gallery in mind, the user can view the top 3 most viewed galleries (found under "Three Most Viewed Galleries" at top of page) or press the "See All Galleries" button to view all galleries on Pixelation PRO's database. If the user views a gallery and is interested in more work by the same artist, users can scroll down to the bottom of the specific gallery page and click the link of the artist's name (username is underlined) to look at all galleries by that artist.

### VIEWING OWN GALLERY
The list of all of the user’s own galleries are found at the very bottom of the homepage, under “My Galleries”. Click the button of the user's gallery to edit the specific gallery.

### CREATING GALLERIES
After successful registration and login, the user can create galleries by choosing a collection of photos to go into each gallery. The user can create a new gallery by pressing the yellow “Add Gallery” button on the homepage, which leads to the edit page. On the edit page, the user must input the desired “Gallery Title”, upload a photo to go into that gallery, as well as a title for that photo. There will be a user error if more than one photos in the same gallery have the exact same name (case sensitive). Additionally, there will be a user error if more than one gallery from the same user have the same name (case sensitive).

### EDITING GALLERIES
After initial creation of the gallery, the user can make further edits to the gallery by viewing their own gallery page (Refer to #VIEWING OWN GALLERY) where the user will have the options: Add more photos, delete photos, rename the gallery, or delete entire galleries.

### COMMENTING
Users can leave comments on galleries by scrolling to the bottom of the gallery page to the comment section. The comments will be anonymous and posted with a timestamp for all viewers of the gallery to see.
